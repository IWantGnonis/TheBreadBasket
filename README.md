I am currently developing an e-commerce website utilizing Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB as the core technologies. The project involves creating a seamless and user-friendly shopping experience, with a focus on dynamic functionality and efficient database management.

At present, I am addressing some backend challenges, including optimizing server-side processes and resolving integration issues. Additionally, I am actively working on improving the add-to-cart functionality and the overall shop features to ensure a smooth and intuitive experience for users. This includes ensuring reliable data handling, enhancing performance, and implementing responsive design elements to meet high standards of usability and efficiency.
